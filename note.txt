Topic: minimal changes to GDL such that a single/two player game is strongly winnable

1. the format of GDL

- only contains GDL keywords and the following types of rules.

init. 

legal :- 0+ many true/not true

next :- 0+ many true/not true, 0+ many does/not does

goal :- arbitary body

terminal :- arbitary body 

- must be grounded?


2. what are the allowed repairs?

legal :- 0+ many true/not true

next :- 0+ many true/not true, 0+ many does/not does

delete from the body of a rule 
add true/does to the body of a rule 
add a new rule
delete a rule


3. how to measure the cost?

1) weighted sum of the changes
    - single player case good
    - multiplayer case is bad, probably no solver 
2) set a limit for each of the 4 repairs, get a repair that is not exceeding the limits
