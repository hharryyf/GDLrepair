The existance of a repair:
1-stage game (polynomial time)

repair with constraints:
                         bounded <= C                    minimal                 implementation
weak winnability        NP-c                           delta-2-P-c             ASP -> clingo /ASP  -> lp2sat -> kissat
termination             sigma-2-P-c                    delta-3-P-c             disjunctive -> clingo / QASP -> qasp2qbf -> qratpre+ -> caqe  
playability             sigma-2-P-c                    delta-3-P-c             disjunctive -> clingo / QASP -> qasp2qbf -> qratpre+ -> caqe
strong winnability      PSPACE-c                       PSPACE-c                QASP -> qasp2qbf -> qratpre+ -> caqe

encoding


experiments:
1. a security game 
2. tic-tac-toe 
3. 8-puzzle 
4. blocks world
solve the bounded problem until SAT 

analyse the repair of tic-tac-toe 

naive method: termination and playablity 



1. weak winnability bounded is NP-c 
Membership. Guess the repair + plan.
Hardness. Repair of cost 0 -> planning -> NP-c

2. termination/playability bounded is sigma-2-P-c
Membership. Guess the repair + co-NP verification.
Hardness. exist + forall 3-DNF -> 2-stage GDL repair problem
stage 1: fix whether the existential variables 
stage 2: execution of the actions

3. strong winnability 
Membership. Guess the repair + solving 2-player game 
Hardness. Repair of cost 0 -> solving 2-player game

4. The delta bound.
Membership. Binary search strategy.
This can be reduced to 2-stage, the repair cost is not 1/inf/inf/inf anymore but 1/2/4/8...
